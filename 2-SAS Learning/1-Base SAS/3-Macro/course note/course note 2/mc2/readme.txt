You need to open and submit the program CRE8DATA.SAS before running any of the
programs. The program CRE8DATA.SAS generates all of the SAS data sets for this
course and stores them in the ORION library, the default path for the SAS
library is s:\workshop.  If you need to make changes to the PATH= value to
designate a different location for the SAS library, change the value in the
%LET statement.  Alternate Data locations have been provided and are included
as a comment section of the CRE8DATA.SAS program. 
 
The demonstration programs and solutions to the exercises are also provided.
