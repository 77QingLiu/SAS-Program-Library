Dear &firstname,

Your SAS process with the Process ID &pid was locking SAS datasets which require updating during the Acme daily processing.

The file locks on these SAS datasets have been removed so that the Acme daily processing could complete successfully.

You should not have lost any work.  

If your SAS session was an Enterprise Guide session, you should save your project, then restart Enterprise Guide.

If your SAS session was a Base SAS session, you should save all your open program editor sessions, then restart your Base SAS Session.

Your SAS session will be in an unstable state.  You should save your work and restart SAS as soon as possible.  Do not continue to use that SAS session.

If you have any questions, please contact someone in the Acme Support Team.

Regards,
Acme Support Team
