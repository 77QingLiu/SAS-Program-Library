<h2>
Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/Spectre/index.html">http://www.datasavantconsulting.com/roland/Spectre/</a>
<p>Spectre has been made available to the public for educational purposes.
The reporting system is in everyday use by a pharmaceutical company. Although
it is in use, you should not assume that the system has been validated
for this purpose. If you use this system for clinical reporting purposes,
rather than just educational purposes, then you must comply with industry
regulations and your own Standard Operating Procedures for QC purposes.
<h2>
Features</h2>

<ul>

for figures)</li>

<li>
Runs every SAS program independently to avoid one program affecting another</li>

<li>
Has a system for handling titles and footnotes such that these can be kept
separate from reporting code modules</li>

<li>
The titles and footnotes system has the potential to call reporting macros</li>
